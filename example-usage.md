# Example Usage

This document shows how to use the IMAP MCP server with Claude Desktop.

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/michaelnikolaus/RiderProjects/ImapClient/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Read-only access (optional)

To give the assistant read-only access — searching, reading, folders, unread
counts, and spam analysis, but no sending, deleting, moving, or flag changes —
set `IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY` in the `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/michaelnikolaus/RiderProjects/ImapClient/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

For a precise, hand-picked allowlist instead, use `IMAP_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS`
(comma-separated tool names). See the README's *Restricting tool access*
section for details.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Failed**: 
   - Ensure you're using app-specific passwords for Gmail/Yahoo
   - Check that IMAP is enabled in your email settings

2. **Connection Timeout**:
   - Verify the host and port settings
   - Check your network connection
   - Some corporate networks block IMAP ports

3. **Folder Not Found**:
   - Use the list folders tool to see available folders
   - Folder names are case-sensitive
   - Gmail uses labels which appear as folders
