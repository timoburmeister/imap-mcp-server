## Installation

> **Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.** Node 18 and 20 have both reached
> end-of-life, and several of this package's dependencies no longer support
> them. Check yours with `node --version`.

### Run via npx (No Installation Required)

Once published to npm, you can run the server directly without cloning or building anything — `npx` downloads the prebuilt package and runs it:

```bash
npx -y imap-mcp-server
```

This is the easiest way to use the server in an MCP client (see [Configuration](#configuration) for ready-to-paste `npx` configs).

### Quick Install (Recommended)

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server.git
cd imap-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Account Setup

Accounts are stored encrypted in `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`. This file is **shared by all run modes** — whether you start the server via `npx`, a global install, or a local clone, they all read the same accounts. So you only need to set up your accounts once.

### Setting Up Accounts in npx Mode

If you run the server via `npx` (no clone), you have two ways to add accounts:

**Option A — Run the setup wizard directly via npx (no install needed):**

```bash
npx -p imap-mcp-server imap-setup
```

This launches the same web-based wizard described below and writes to `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`, which your `npx`-configured MCP server then picks up automatically.

**Option B — Add accounts straight from your AI client:**

Once the MCP server is configured, just ask your assistant to add an account — it uses the `imap_add_account` tool. For example:

> "Add my IMAP account: host imap.gmail.com, port 993, user me@gmail.com, password …"

No separate setup step required.

### Web-Based Setup Wizard (Recommended)

After installation, run the setup wizard:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
imap-setup
```

Or directly via npx without installing:

```bash
npx -p imap-mcp-server imap-setup
```

This will:
1. Start a local web server
2. Open your browser to the setup wizard
3. Guide you through adding email accounts with pre-configured settings

### Overriding Credentials via Environment Variables

You can override the username and password of an already-configured account at
runtime with environment variables — useful when you inject secrets from a
password manager or CI system instead of storing them in `accounts.json`.

The variables are keyed by the account **name**, uppercased with every
non-alphanumeric character replaced by `_`. For an account named `Work Gmail`
(key `WORK_GMAIL`):

| Variable | Overrides |
| --- | --- |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_USERNAME` | IMAP username (`user`) |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_PASSWORD` | IMAP password |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME` | SMTP username (`smtp.user`) |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password |

Notes:
- Overrides apply **only to existing accounts**; if no account's normalized name
  matches, the variable is ignored.
- They are applied **in memory only** — nothing is written back to
  `accounts.json`, and the values are used as-is (not re-encrypted).
- Variables are **consumed at startup**: on server start they are captured into
  an AES-256-encrypted in-memory cache and removed from `process.env`, so the
  plaintext secret does not linger in the environment (where it could leak to
  child processes or diagnostics). Set them before launching the server.

The setup wizard integrates with this: each credential field (IMAP password,
IMAP username, SMTP username, SMTP password) has a **"Do not save to config; set
later using an environment variable"** checkbox. When ticked, the value you enter
is still used to test the connection, but it is not written to `accounts.json` —
the wizard shows the exact variable name to export, and the account picks the
credential up from that variable at runtime.
- SMTP variables take effect only when the account already has an SMTP config.
- Each variable takes effect independently; set only the ones you need.

**If the variable is missing**, the account still holds the empty placeholder the
wizard wrote. Rather than dialing out with a blank credential — which providers
answer with a generic authentication failure that looks exactly like a wrong
password — the server refuses the connection and names what to set:

```
Account "Work Gmail" has IMAP credentials marked as environment-managed, but
this variable was not set when the server started:
IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_PASSWORD. Set it and restart the server, or
store the credentials on the account via imap_update_account.
```

Because the variables are read once at startup, setting one in an already-running
shell has no effect until the server is restarted.

### Supported Email Providers

The setup wizard includes pre-configured settings for:
- Gmail / Google Workspace
- Microsoft Outlook / Hotmail / Live
- Yahoo Mail
- Apple iCloud Mail
- GMX
- WEB.DE
- IONOS (1&1)
- ProtonMail (with Bridge)
- Fastmail
- Zoho Mail
- AOL Mail
- mailbox.org
- Posteo
- Custom IMAP servers

## Configuration

### Claude Code (CLI)

#### Option A — via npx (no clone/build needed)

```bash
claude mcp add imap -- npx -y imap-mcp-server
```

This always runs the latest published version and requires no local build.

#### Option B — from a local clone

If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) in the terminal, add the MCP server with a single command:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have built the project first (see [Manual Installation](#manual-installation)).

**Step 2:** Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add imap -- node /absolute/path/to/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

> **Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/imap-mcp-server` with the actual path where you cloned the repository. For example:
> ```bash
> # macOS/Linux example:
> claude mcp add imap -- node /Users/yourname/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js
>
> # Windows example:
> claude mcp add imap -- node C:\Users\yourname\imap-mcp-server\dist\index.js
> ```

**Step 3:** Verify it was added:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `imap` in the list of configured MCP servers. That's it — the IMAP tools are now available in your Claude Code sessions.

> **Tip:** If you want to remove the server later, run:
> ```bash
> claude mcp remove imap
> ```

### Claude Desktop (GUI App)

Add the IMAP MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Option A — via npx (recommended, no clone/build needed):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — from a local clone:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Restricting tool access (read-only mode / allowlist)

By default all tools are exposed. You can restrict which tools the agent sees
using two environment variables (set them under the `env` key of your MCP
config). This is useful when you want to give an assistant **read-only** access
to a mailbox, or expose only a hand-picked subset of tools.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY` | When truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`), only the safe, read-only tools are registered — searching, reading, listing folders, unread counts, spam analysis. No tool that sends mail, deletes/moves messages, changes flags, or edits accounts is exposed. |
| `IMAP_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated allowlist of tool names — only these are registered. Names are case-insensitive and the `imap_` prefix is optional (`search_emails` ≡ `imap_search_emails`). When set, it takes precedence over `IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY`. |

**Example — read-only access:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example — explicit allowlist:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "IMAP_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS": "imap_search_emails,imap_get_email,imap_get_latest_emails" }
    }
  }
}
```

The read-only subset is: `imap_list_accounts`, `imap_connect`, `imap_disconnect`,
`imap_test_account`, `imap_search_emails`, `imap_get_email`,
`imap_get_latest_emails`, `imap_download_attachment`, `imap_find_thread_messages`,
`imap_find_email_by_message_id`, `imap_list_folders`, `imap_folder_status`,
`imap_get_unread_count`, `imap_check_spam`, `imap_domain_stats`,
`imap_list_spam_domains`.

## Usage

Once configured, the IMAP MCP server provides the following tools in Claude:

> **Choosing an account.** For the email and folder tools, `accountId` is
> **optional** and backward-compatible. You may instead pass `accountName`, and
> if you only have a **single** account configured you can omit both — that
> account is used by default. With multiple accounts and no selector, the tool
> returns a clear error listing your options (`imap_list_accounts`).

### Account Management

- **imap_add_account**: Add a new IMAP account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - name: Friendly name for the account
  - host: IMAP server hostname
  - port: Server port (default: 993)
  - user: Username
  - password: Password
  - tls: Use TLS/SSL (default: true)
  - allowStartTLS: When tls is false, set to false to also disable the
      opportunistic STARTTLS upgrade imapflow otherwise attempts whenever the
      server advertises it (validating the cert against `host` regardless of
      `tls`). Needed for providers that advertise STARTTLS on a hostname
      covered only by a shared/wildcard cert. Defaults to true.
  - sentFolder: Explicit Sent-folder name for sent-mail copies, e.g. "Gesendet"
      (optional — only needed when the server has no \Sent SPECIAL-USE folder
      and auto-detection fails)
  - defaultBcc: Optional BCC address(es) applied automatically to every
      outbound send, reply, forward, and draft for this account. Merged with
      any per-call `bcc` (duplicates removed case-insensitively)
  ```

- **imap_update_account**: Update an existing account (fix SMTP settings, rename, etc.)
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: ID of the account to update
  - name, host, port, user, password, tls, allowStartTLS, email: IMAP fields (all optional)
  - smtpHost, smtpPort, smtpSecure, smtpUser, smtpPassword: SMTP fields (optional)
  - saveToSent: Save sent emails to the Sent folder (optional)
  - sentFolder: Explicit Sent-folder override (optional). Pass an empty string
      to clear the override and re-enable auto-detection
  - defaultBcc: Optional default BCC address(es) (optional). Pass an empty
      string to clear
  ```

- **imap_list_accounts**: List all configured accounts

- **imap_remove_account**: Remove an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: ID of the account to remove
  ```

- **imap_connect**: Connect to an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId OR accountName: Account identifier
  ```

- **imap_disconnect**: Disconnect from an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account to disconnect
  ```

### Email Operations

- **imap_search_emails**: Search for emails
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX; ignored when searchAllFolders is true)
  - searchAllFolders: Search across ALL folders at once (default: false).
      Skips Trash/Spam/Drafts and non-selectable folders by default. Use when a
      message may have been filed/moved/archived and you don't know its folder.
  - includeTrash, includeSpam, includeDrafts: Opt those noisy folders back into
      a searchAllFolders run (default: false each)
  - from, to, subject, body: Search criteria
  - since, before: Date filters
  - seen, flagged: Status filters
  - keywords: Match messages with ANY of these custom keywords (server-side OR).
      Read a mailbox's available custom keywords from `imap_folder_status`'s
      `customKeywords` field first.
  - unKeywords: Exclude messages with ANY of these custom keywords (result has
      NONE of them). Same keyword source as `keywords`.
  - limit: Max results (default: 50)
  - includeBody: Include parsed message body in the response (default: false).
      Fetches the RFC822 source once and parses it with mailparser, so you get
      uid + body in a single tool call instead of paying the N+1 cost of one
      `imap_get_email` per match. Body is rendered per `bodyFormat` and capped
      at `bodyMaxLength` per field.
  - bodyFormat: How to render the body when `includeBody` is true — `markdown`
      (default, clean Markdown via Turndown), `text`, `html`, or `auto`.
  - bodyMaxLength: Per-field cap when `includeBody` is true (default: 10000).
  ```
  > With `searchAllFolders`, results include a `folder` field per message plus
  > `foldersSearched`, and any folder that failed to open is reported in
  > `foldersErrored` (so a 0-result answer is never silently incomplete).
  >
  > `includeBody` is honored in the single-folder path only. For a
  > cross-folder sweep the lightweight header shape is preserved by design —
  > pulling RFC822 source for every match across many folders would multiply
  > bandwidth and parse cost. Follow up with `imap_get_email` for the specific
  > uids whose bodies you need.
  >
  > On some servers a "flagged"/starred message carries a custom keyword (e.g.
  > an Open-Xchange color label or Apple's `$MailFlagBit*`) instead of, or in
  > addition to, the `\Flagged` system flag — after any flagged search, check
  > each result's `customKeywords` field before concluding a message is or
  > isn't flagged.

- **imap_get_email**: Get full email content
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  - maxContentLength: Max characters for text/html body (default: 10000)
  - includeAttachmentText: Include text attachment previews (default: true)
  - maxAttachmentTextChars: Max characters per text attachment (default: 100000)
  ```

- **imap_get_latest_emails**: Get recent emails
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX)
  - count: Number of emails (default: 10)
  - includeBody: Include parsed message body (default: false). Same semantics
      as the `includeBody` option on `imap_search_emails` — one round-trip
      instead of N×`imap_get_email`.
  - bodyFormat: `markdown` (default), `text`, `html`, or `auto`.
  - bodyMaxLength: Per-field cap (default: 10000).
  ```

- **imap_mark_as_read/unread**: Change email read status
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID, OR an array of UIDs to flag in one call. Batch uses a
      single IMAP STORE so the operation is atomic at the server level — all
      UIDs are flagged, or none. Useful when triaging many messages at once.
  ```

- **imap_flag_email/unflag_email**: Star/unstar an email (sets or clears the IMAP \Flagged system flag — shows as a "star" in Gmail and Apple Mail). Some servers/clients (Open-Xchange, Apple Mail) also set a separate custom keyword (e.g. `$cl_N`, `$MailFlagBit*`) when flagging; unflag only clears `\Flagged`, so if a message still shows as flagged, check `customKeywords` via `imap_get_email` and clear it with `imap_remove_keyword`.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  ```

- **imap_add_keyword/remove_keyword**: Set or clear an arbitrary *custom* (non-system) IMAP keyword/label on an email, passed through verbatim (e.g. provider color labels like Open-Xchange's `$cl_1`..`$cl_10` or Apple Mail's `$MailFlagBit0`..`$MailFlagBit2`, or any other custom keyword). Backslash-prefixed system flags (e.g. `\Flagged`, `\Seen`, `\Deleted`) are rejected — use the dedicated flag/read tools for those. Not every server permits custom-keyword changes (see the mailbox's PERMANENTFLAGS); if the server rejects or silently ignores the change, the call fails instead of reporting success.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  - keyword: IMAP keyword to set/remove (e.g. "$cl_3")
  ```

- **imap_delete_email**: Delete an email
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  ```

- **imap_move_email**: Move an email from one folder to another
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Source folder name (default: INBOX)
  - uid: Email UID, OR an array of UIDs to move in one call. Batch moves are
      attributed per-uid in the response (`results[]` with per-uid `uidMap`
      and any errors). Single-uid calls return the legacy response shape.
  - targetFolder: Destination folder name
  - createDestinationIfMissing: Create the destination folder if it does not exist (default: false)
  ```

- **imap_find_thread_messages**: Find inbox messages that belong to the same conversation threads as messages already sorted into another folder. Uses RFC 3501 HEADER search on In-Reply-To and References — works on any IMAP server.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - sourceFolder: Folder containing the already-sorted thread messages
  - searchFolder: Folder to search for related messages (default: INBOX)
  - searchReferences: Also match the References header for multi-level threads (default: true)
  - includeBody: Include parsed message body for each found thread message
      (default: false). Same semantics as the `includeBody` option on
      `imap_search_emails` — one round-trip instead of N×`imap_get_email`.
  - bodyFormat: `markdown` (default), `text`, `html`, or `auto`.
  - bodyMaxLength: Per-field cap (default: 10000).
  ```

- **imap_download_attachment**: Download an email attachment (returns images inline, extracts text from PDFs, or saves to downloads directory)
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX)
  - uid: Email UID
  - filename: Attachment filename or contentId (as listed by imap_get_email; NFC/NFD
      spellings of accented characters are treated as equal, and a contentId may
      be passed with or without angle brackets)
  - savePath: Optional file path to save the attachment to
  - extractText: For PDFs, extract and return text content inline (default: true)
  ```

- **imap_bulk_delete**: Delete multiple emails at once with chunking and auto-reconnection
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX)
  - uids: Array of email UIDs to delete
  - chunkSize: Emails to delete per batch (default: 50)
  ```

- **imap_bulk_delete_by_search**: Search for emails matching criteria and delete them all
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX)
  - from, to, subject: Search criteria (optional)
  - before, since: Date filters (optional)
  - chunkSize: Emails to delete per batch (default: 50)
  - dryRun: Preview what would be deleted without deleting (default: false)
  ```
  At least one concrete criterion (`from`, `to`, `subject`, `before`, or `since`)
  is required — a call with no criteria is refused, so it can never match and
  delete an entire folder. On servers whose SEARCH is broken (see
  Troubleshooting → Search returns nothing) this tool, `imap_delete_spam` and
  `imap_delete_by_domain` return an error instead of deleting from a
  client-side match.

- **imap_send_email**: Send a new email
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID to send from
  - to: Recipient email address(es) — an array, or a single comma-separated string
  - subject: Email subject
  - text: Plain text content (optional)
  - html: HTML content (optional)
  - cc: CC recipients (optional)
  - bcc: BCC recipients (optional)
  - replyTo: Reply-to address (optional)
  - attachments: Array of attachments (optional)
    - filename: Attachment filename
    - content: Base64 encoded content; provide exactly one of `content` or `path`
    - path: Readable local file path to attach; provide exactly one of `path` or `content`
    - contentType: MIME type (optional; detected from the filename extension when omitted)
    - contentDisposition: "attachment" (default) or "inline" — use "inline" for images shown in the HTML body via cid:
    - cid: Content-ID for inline attachments; must match the `cid:` value used in an `<img src="cid:...">` tag in `html`
  - dryRun: Validate attachments and compose MIME without sending or saving to Sent (optional, default: false)
  ```
  Attachments are validated before SMTP is contacted. Invalid base64, unreadable
  paths, missing filenames, ambiguous sources, and inline attachments without
  `cid` fail fast. Successful sends and dry-runs return `attachmentCount` and
  safe `attachmentDiagnostics`: filename, MIME type, size, source, disposition,
  and cid. Diagnostics omit bytes, raw MIME, and local file paths.

  For large files, upload with `imap_upload_file` first and pass its returned
  local `path`; for inline images, set `contentDisposition: "inline"` and a
  matching `cid`.

  After sending, a copy is saved to the account's Sent folder (unless
  `saveToSent` is disabled on the account). The folder is resolved via the
  account's `sentFolder` override → the server's `\Sent` SPECIAL-USE flag →
  a list of known localized names ("Sent", "Gesendet", "Éléments envoyés", …).
  The response reports the outcome: `savedToSent` (boolean), `sentFolder`
  (the folder used), and — when the save fails — `sentSaveError` explaining
  why, instead of failing silently. The same applies to `imap_reply_to_email`
  and `imap_forward_email`.

  When the account has `defaultBcc` configured, those address(es) are always
  BCC'd on send, reply, forward, and draft (merged with any per-call `bcc`;
  duplicates removed case-insensitively). The Bcc header is kept in the MIME
  stored for drafts and Sent-folder copies so mail clients show it.

- **imap_save_draft**: Save an email as a draft (no send). Takes the same fields as `imap_send_email`, plus `inReplyTo`, `references`, and an optional `folder` override for the Drafts folder.

- **imap_reply_to_email**: Reply to an existing email
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder containing the original email
  - uid: UID of the email to reply to
  - text: Plain text reply content (optional)
  - html: HTML reply content (optional)
  - replyAll: Reply to all recipients (default: false)
  - bcc: BCC recipients (optional; merged with account defaultBcc)
  - attachments: Array of attachments (optional, same shape as imap_send_email, including contentDisposition/cid for inline images)
  ```

- **imap_forward_email**: Forward an existing email
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder containing the original email
  - uid: UID of the email to forward
  - to: Forward to email address(es)
  - text: Additional text to include (optional)
  - bcc: BCC recipients (optional; merged with account defaultBcc)
  - includeAttachments: Include original attachments (default: true)
  ```

### Folder Operations

- **imap_list_folders**: List all folders
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  ```
  Each folder includes its `attributes` (raw IMAP LIST flags) and, when the
  server advertises it, `specialUse` — the RFC 6154 role (`\Sent`, `\Drafts`,
  `\Trash`, `\Junk`, `\Archive`) that identifies a folder independent of its
  localized display name (e.g. "Gesendet" carries `specialUse: "\Sent"`).

- **imap_folder_status**: Get folder information
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name

  Returns:
  - messages: { total, new, unseen } — from IMAP STATUS
  - uidvalidity, uidnext
  - flags, permanentFlags: string arrays
  - customKeywords: the mailbox's non-system keywords, usable as the
      `keywords` / `unKeywords` input of imap_search_emails
  ```

- **imap_create_folder**: Create a new IMAP folder/mailbox. Most servers also create any missing parent folders. Returns success even if the folder already exists.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Full folder path to create (e.g. "Archives/2026/2026-05" or "INBOX.Archive")
  ```

- **imap_get_unread_count**: Count unread emails
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folders: Specific folders (optional)
  ```

## Security

- Credentials are encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption
- Encryption keys are stored separately in `~/.imap-mcp/.key`
- Account configurations are stored in `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`
- The store directory, `.key`, and `accounts.json` are written owner-only
  (`0700`/`0600`) so other local users cannot read the key or the credentials
- The web setup wizard's HTTP API never returns stored passwords to the browser
- Downloaded attachments are confined to the downloads directory; sender-supplied
  filenames cannot write outside it
- Never commit or share your encryption key or account configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your IMAP server settings are correct
- Check if your email provider requires app-specific passwords
- Verify that IMAP is enabled in your email account settings
- For sending emails, ensure your account has SMTP access enabled

### Recipients arriving as `["a@x.com","b@y.com"]`

`to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `references` and `uid` accept either a single value or an
array. In JSON Schema that is an `anyOf`, and some MCP clients drop the `anyOf`
before showing the schema to the model — the field then looks untyped or
string-typed, and the client serializes the model's array into a string. The
server used to pass that string straight to nodemailer, which folded the
literal `[` and `]` into the first and last address, so every recipient was
rejected by the receiving mail server (issue #127).

The server now detects a stringified array and restores it, both when
validating tool input and again before composing the message, and logs a
warning to stderr naming the field. Nothing needs to change on your side. If
you want to bypass the client behavior entirely, pass recipients as one
comma-separated string: `"Alice <alice@example.com>, Bob <bob@example.org>"`.

### Search returns nothing although the folder has mail (Strato)

Since mid-2026 Strato's IMAP server (`imap.strato.com`) answers every SEARCH
command with an empty result, while FETCH still works (issue #138). The server
detects this: when a SEARCH comes back empty for a folder that is not empty and
`SEARCH ALL` is empty as well, it fetches the envelopes and applies the
criteria itself. `imap_search_emails`, `imap_find_thread_messages`, the unread counts and the
spam analysis keep working; `imap_get_latest_emails` never needed SEARCH.

Limits of the fallback:

- It is slower — every envelope of the folder is downloaded per search.
- A `body` search downloads and parses each remaining candidate, so it is
  refused above 2000 candidates; narrow it with `since`/`from`/`subject`.
- Deleting tools (`imap_bulk_delete_by_search`, `imap_delete_spam`,
  `imap_delete_by_domain`) do **not** use it and return an error instead. Find
  the messages with `imap_search_emails` and delete their UIDs with
  `imap_bulk_delete`.

### SMTP Configuration

The server automatically configures SMTP settings based on your IMAP provider. If you need custom SMTP settings, you can specify them when adding an account:

```json
{
  "smtp": {
    "host": "smtp.example.com",
    "port": 587,
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

### Common IMAP Settings

- **Gmail**: 
  - Host: imap.gmail.com
  - Port: 993
  - Requires app-specific password

- **Outlook/Hotmail**:
  - Host: outlook.office365.com
  - Port: 993

- **Yahoo**:
  - Host: imap.mail.yahoo.com
  - Port: 993
  - Requires app-specific password
